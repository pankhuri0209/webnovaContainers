# Container CV WebNova


# WebNova ContainerChallenge

## The objective:

      To count the differences in the containers   between 2 images of the same Latitude/Longitude


## Solution:
     
     The 2 images are run through the sift detect and compare.  
     
     Then, they are fed through the BruteForce compare ( BFCompare ) for matching. 

     The distance difference against a threshold is used to calculate the differences. 

## Output:

     The differential imagery and the length of the differences in the objects detected - the difference in number  of containers, 
     is reported in the output directory.
